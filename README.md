## Package name: [*smart_arrays_compress*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_compress)

The compression algorithms provided by this package don't have anything to do with audio or video compression. Instead, their purpose is to reduce large arrays to a size suitable for fast interactive viewing on a screen by retaining significant aspects of the array data. For this purpose an array is fragmented into intervals (1D) or submatrices (2D). The minimum and maximum values in these regions constitue the compressed array. You would apply the algorithms to arrays with thousands, ten thousands or even millions of elements. The reduced size should, for example, be chosen to match display resolution if compression is applied for data viewing.

## Package name: [*smart_arrays_sample_data*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_sample_data)

It is often the case that one needs sample data for testing software, for presentations and other purposes. This package computes one and two-dimensional arrays representing functions such a sine, cosine, and more.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## Package name: [*smart_arrays_dbstore*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_dbstore)

This package was designed for Web applications which need to store data on the local device (PC, tablet, phone) over a longer time period, e.g. to view or process the data by a Web app during multiple sessions. The package is capable of saving one- and two-dimensional arrays of double values and String-valued maps in databases, optionally along with metadata containing additional information about the actual array data.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## Package name: [*smart_arrays_plot_polyline*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_plot_polyline)

This package was designed for Web applications which need to plot 1D arrays in form of polylines (curves in the x, y plane). A plot may consist of one or several polylines (scaled relative to each other if desired), optionally with x and y axes, a coordinate grid, a text legend, selection icons, and marker text. Many array viewing options are provided, such as colors, fonts, zooming, scaling, shifting, rotation, layout parameters. Also, lists of points represented by circles or other shapes can be drawn, e.g.to draw a curve using individual points rather than connecting the points by polylines. The arrays to be plotted may have small or big sizes (even e.g. 1 million points). Plotting is performed using Scalable Vector Graphics SVG.

## Package name: [*smart_arrays_peaks*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_peaks)

This package provides functions that detect peaks (maximum values) in one- or two-dimensional arrays. Peak detection (peak search, peak picking) does not simply mean finding maximum values. Data originating from measurements are often subject to noise, i.e. random small variations of the measured values. The provided algorithms therefore allow you to specify a noise value to exclude noise effects from peak search.

## Package name: [*smart_arrays_contour_finder*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_contour_finder)

The purpose of this package is to contour the three-dimensional surface represented by the values f(x,y) of a matrix with coordinate axes x and y. The detected contour lines are passed on to a user-provided renderer e.g. for graphical displaying the contours.The provided example can be directly executed via the following link. Or, download the package and execute the file `example/example.dart.js` in your browser.

## Package name: [*smart_arrays_lmfit*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_arrays_lmfit)

The purpose of this package is to fit "experimental data" to a "fit function" representing a model for the experimental data. These must be specified as an array of x values and an an array of the respective y values.

## Package name: [*smart_lorentz_gauss*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_lorentz_gauss)

This package provides functionalities to compute an n-dimensional mixed Lorentz-Gauss line shape, also called an n-dimensional Pseudo-Voigt function. Typically such functions occur in spectroscopic data originating from electro-magnetic radiation. The function can for example be used for fitting or deconvolution of such data, or for simulating (computing) spectra, i.e. as a superposition of several shapes with different parameters.

## Package name: [*smart_signal_processing*](https://pub.dev/packages/smart_signal_processing)

This package provides frequently used functions for signal processing:

- Computes mean values, variance, standard deviation.
- Applies windowing (apodization functions) with exponential or Gaussian shapes to an array
- Applies the Fast Fourier Transform to an array.
- Calculates the power or magnitude of a complex-valued array.
- Phase-shifts (rotates in the complex plane) a complex-valued array.
